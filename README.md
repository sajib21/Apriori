# Apriori
Implemented Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Pattern Mining. It was a lab task of the Data Mining and Machine Learning course.

# Funny Back Story
I didn't do the assignment at first. But then, in the lab, our respected sir told us that that day is the last day he is going to see this assignment. <br/>
I had only two hours in my hand when I started coding. I was sure that I couldn't complete it in time but I never stopped. <br/>
And finally, I don't know how I pulled this out of myself within two hours but I did it (Only insert functionality was required). I consider it one of the greatest challenge in my coding career so far. :D :D <br/>
